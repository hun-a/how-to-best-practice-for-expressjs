# What's this?

- This is a best practice for ExpressJs that introduce to us how we create the ExpressJS App.
- We referred the source codes from [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/expressjs/index.htm)!

# Why ExpressJS?

- ExpressJS will help you to create the Web Server as easily, flexible and faster.

# Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and HTML.
- Basic knowledge of MongoDB will help you a little.
- Install the NodeJS and some libraries.
  - You can install NodeJS from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)!
  - You can install the `nodemon` for convenience to restart your application when you develop.
  - When you deploy this App to production, you can install the `pm2` for managing NodeJS processes.
- That's it!

# How to run?

- Use below command when simply run this App using default node executor.

  ```
  $ npm run start
  ```

- If you installed `nodemon` then run the below command.

  > Note. Use `pm2` rather then `nodemon` in your production environment.

  ```
  $ npm run dev
  ```

- If you installed `nodemon` then run the below command.
